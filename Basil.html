  <h2>Basil</h2>
        <p class="plants"><strong>Scientific Name:</strong> <em>Ocimum basilicum</em></p>
        <p class="plants"><strong>Family:</strong> Lamiaceae</p>
        <p class="plants"><strong>Native Range:</strong> Native to tropical regions of central Africa and Southeast Asia.</p>
        <p class="plants"><strong>Description:</strong> A popular culinary herb known for its fragrant leaves, which are widely used in cooking, especially in Italian dishes.</p>
        <p class="plants"><strong>Care Tips:</strong> Prefers full sunlight, well-drained soil, and regular watering. Pinch off tops to encourage bushier growth.</p>
        <p class="plants"><strong>Interesting Fact:</strong> Basil is considered a sacred herb in some cultures and is often associated with love and protection.</p>
        <p class="plants"><strong>Basil: Basil is one of the most popular culinary herbs. It’s a warm-weather annual that can be planted outdoors once temperatures are consistently above 50°F. 
          Basil is not usually seeded directly into the soil; typically, gardeners transplant small starter plants purchased at a nursery. Or, they may start the seeds themselves indoors under grow lights.Basil will grow best in a location that gets 6 to 8 hours of full sun daily, though it can perform well in partial sun, too.
          Soil should be moderately fertile and moist but well-draining. Basil works great in containers or raised beds, as these allow for better drainage. The pH of the soil should ideally be in the range of 6.0 to 7.5 (slightly acidic to neutral).
          If you plan on cooking with these plants, plant in clean soil, don’t use insecticides, and grow them away from driveways and busy streets so exhaust won’t settle on the plants.</strong></p>
        <p class="plants"><strong>How to Grow Basil</strong></p>
        <p class="plants">•Make sure that the soil is moist. Basil plants like moisture.</p>
        <p class="plants">•If you live in a hot area, use mulch around the plants (the mulch will help hold in moisture and suppress weeds).</p>
        <p class="plants">•During the dry periods in summer, water the plants freely.</p>
        <p class="plants">•After the seedlings have produced their first six leaves, prune above the second set. This encourages the plants to start branching, resulting in more leaves for harvest.</p>
        <p class="plants">•Every time a branch has six to eight leaves, repeat pruning the branches back to their first set of leaves.</p>
        <p class="plants">•Fertilize sparingly throughout the season with a 5-10-5 fertilizer.</p>
        <p class="plants">•After about 6 weeks, pinch off the center shoot to prevent early flowering. If flowers do grow, just cut them off.</p>
        <p class="plants">•If the weather is going to be cold or if a sudden frost is imminent, be sure to harvest your basil beforehand, as the cold temperatures will destroy your plants.</p>
