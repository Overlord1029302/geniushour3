  <h2 >Orchid</h2>
  <p class="plants"><strong>Scientific Name:</strong> <em>Orchidaceae</em> (family of over 25,000 species)</p>
  <p class="plants"><strong>Family:</strong> Orchidaceae</p>
  <p class="plants"><strong>Native Range:</strong> Found worldwide, particularly in tropical regions.</p>
  <p class="plants"><strong>Description:</strong> Known for their stunning flowers and diversity, orchids come in many shapes, sizes, and colors, symbolizing beauty and refinement.</p>
  <p class="plants"><strong>Care Tips:</strong> Prefer bright, indirect light and require a specific potting mix (orchid bark). Water when the potting medium is nearly dry.</p>
  <p class="plants"><strong>Interesting Fact:</strong> Some orchids can remain in bloom for several months, making them popular indoor plants.</p>
  <p class="plants">Orchids thrive in environments with bright, indirect light. They prefer well-draining, orchid-specific potting mix and should be watered thoroughly but infrequently, allowing the roots to dry out between waterings. It's best to use rainwater or distilled water, as orchids are sensitive to minerals in tap water.</p>
  <p class="plants">Fertilize orchids with a balanced, water-soluble fertilizer once a month during their growing season, typically spring and summer. Orchids also benefit from high humidity, which can be achieved by placing the pot on a tray of water with pebbles. Repot orchids every two to three years to refresh the growing medium and provide space for new growth.</p>
  <p class="plants">Originating from tropical regions, orchids are prized for their exotic beauty and diversity, with over 25,000 species. They symbolize love, luxury, and beauty. Orchids are known for their unique flower structures and long-lasting blooms, making them a favorite among plant enthusiasts</p>
