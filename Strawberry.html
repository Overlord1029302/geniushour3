<h2>Strawberry</h2>
<font size="5">
<p><strong>Scientific Name:</strong> <em>Fragaria × ananassa</em></p>
<p><strong>Family:</strong> Rosaceae</p>
<p><strong>Native Range:</strong> Native to North America.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> A sweet, red fruit with tiny seeds on its outer skin, strawberries are delicious eaten fresh or used in desserts, jams, and beverages.</p>
<p><strong>Care Tips:</strong> Strawberries prefer well-drained soil and full sun. They require regular watering and benefit from mulch to retain moisture.</p>
<p><strong>Interesting Fact:</strong> Strawberries are the only fruit with seeds on the outside, and they are also considered an “aggregate fruit” because they form from multiple ovaries.</p>
<p>Strawberries prefer well-drained, sandy soil rich in organic matter. They thrive in a location that receives full sun, about 6-8 hours per day. Plant strawberry plants in the early spring after the last frost, spacing them about 12-18 inches apart in rows spaced 3-4 feet apart. It's important to plant them so that the crowns are just above the soil level.</p>
<p>Water strawberries consistently, keeping the soil evenly moist but not waterlogged. Mulching around the plants helps retain moisture, suppress weeds, and keep the fruit clean. Fertilize with a balanced, slow-release fertilizer at the time of planting and again during the growing season. Regularly remove any runners to prevent overcrowding and promote better fruit production.</p>
<p>Originating from Europe and North America, strawberries are beloved for their sweet, juicy flavor and versatility in culinary uses. There are many varieties, including June-bearing, everbearing, and day-neutral types, each with their own growing and fruiting habits. Rich in vitamins, fiber, and antioxidants, strawberries are a nutritious addition to any garden</p>
