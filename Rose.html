<h2>Rose</h2>
        <p class="plants"><strong>Scientific Name:</strong> <em>Rosa</em></p>
        <p class="plants"><strong>Family:</strong> Rosaceae</p>
        <p class="plants"><strong>Native Range:</strong> Various regions across the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
        <p class="plants"><strong>Description:</strong> Known for their beautiful blooms and fragrant scent, roses come in a wide variety of colors and sizes. They are often used in gardens, as cut flowers, and for special occasions.</p>
        <p class="plants"><strong>Care Tips:</strong> Require full sun and well-drained soil. Regular pruning and deadheading encourage new blooms.</p>
        <p class="plants"><strong>Interesting Fact:</strong> Roses have been cultivated for thousands of years and symbolize love and beauty in many cultures.</p>
        <p class="plants"><strong>Rose care is easier than you thinkâ€”anyone can grow them successfully. Plant your roses in a sunny location with good drainage. Fertilize them regularly for impressive flowers. Water them evenly to keep the soil moist. Prune established rose bushes in early spring. Watch for diseases like powdery mildew or black spot.</strong></p>
        <p class="plants">Roses thrive in areas with plenty of direct sunlight, ideally 6-8 hours per day. They prefer well-draining soil enriched with organic matter. When planting, it's best to dig a hole that's twice the width and depth of the rose's root ball and mix in compost or other organic matter to provide nutrients.</p>
        <p class="plants">Water roses deeply and regularly, especially during dry spells, aiming to keep the soil consistently moist but not waterlogged. Mulching around the base of the plant helps retain moisture and suppress weeds. Fertilize roses in early spring with a balanced, slow-release fertilizer and again during the growing season to encourage continuous blooming.</p>
        <p class="plants">Roses are native to many regions around the world and are beloved for their beauty and fragrance. With over 300 species and thousands of cultivars, roses symbolize love, beauty, and passion. They are widely used in gardens, bouquets, and for various cultural and artistic expressions. Regular pruning helps maintain their shape and promotes healthy growth and abundant blooms</p>
